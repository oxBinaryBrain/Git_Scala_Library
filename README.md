## About Me...

Hello there! I'm [oxBinaryBrain](https://github.com/oxBinaryBrain), a passionate programmer with a keen interest in data science and software development. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects.

## Scala Project Repository Analysis

I recently conducted an analysis of the Scala project repository, which is a mature programming language with a history spanning over ten years. This analysis focused on identifying top contributors and experts based on pull request data.

With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.

We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts

## Input data

The dataset we will use, which has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub, is comprised of three files:

pulls_2011-2013.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014. 

pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.

pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.

##  Mini-Projects and Contributions

Aside from analyzing the Scala project repository, I've been actively contributing to various open-source projects. You can explore my repositories to see the projects I've worked on and contributions I've made.

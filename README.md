## About Me

Hello there! I'm [oxBinaryBrain](https://github.com/oxBinaryBrain), a passionate programmer with a keen interest in data science and software development. I'm constantly exploring new technologies and contributing to open-source projects.

## Scala Project Repository Analysis

I recently conducted an analysis of the Scala project repository, which is a mature programming language with a history spanning over ten years. This analysis focused on identifying top contributors and experts based on pull request data.


## Projects and Contributions

Aside from analyzing the Scala project repository, I've been actively contributing to various open-source projects. You can explore my repositories to see the projects I've worked on and contributions I've made.
